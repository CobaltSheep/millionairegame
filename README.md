# millionairegame
This is a game I made with a partner during a computer science course over the summer. The goal of the game is to make money while also having to deal with basic necessities like food, sleep, and lodging. You can also gamble, take loans, and invest.

**Disclaimer: Project is not very recent, so instructions may be iffy. 

Here is the link to the project which is currently running on a server for ATDP in Berkeley
https://atdpsites.berkeley.edu/lsnoey/

The server is currently down right now for maintenance for some time so the project is currently not available. Should open up soon though.
